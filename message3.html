	<p>GM, I can't even begin to comprehend mathwizard@aol.com's hypocrisy! They feast on meat in real life but have the audacity to lecture me about animal cruelty in the game. It's laughable! They should take a long, hard look in the mirror before pointing fingers. Please make them realize the absurdity of their accusations.</p>
