	<p> Subject: Unbelievable Hypocrisy: Vegan Adventurer's Actions</p>
	<p>GM, I can't take it anymore! veganadventurer@me.com keeps summoning innocent animals to set off deadly traps, all in the name of their druidic powers. How is that not blatant animal cruelty? They're the one being hypocritical by claiming to care about animals while putting them in harm's way for a game. It's absurd, and I won't stand for it!</p>
