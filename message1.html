	<p>Subject: Urgent: Summoned Animal Assistance Needed</p>
	<p>GM, I urgently need to address mathwizard@aol.com's outrageous accusations! They claim that summoning animals to trigger deadly traps in the game is cruel and hypocritical. Can you believe it? It's a harmless game mechanic, and I'm just exercising my druidic powers. Please enlighten mathwizard about the difference between appreciating nature and real-life animal welfare.</p>
