<p>Subject: Lack of Compassion: Non-Vegan Player's Complaints</p>
<p>GM, mathwizard@aol.com's lack of compassion astounds me. They have no qualms about devouring meat but suddenly become the self-proclaimed protector of animals in the game. It's the epitome of hypocrisy! I summon animals for strategic purposes, not out of cruelty. Can you please enlighten mathwizard about the difference between a game and real-life ethics?</p>
