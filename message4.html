	<p>Subject: Excessive Vegan Extremism: GM's Attention Needed</p>
	<p>Preview: GM, I'm beyond fed up with veganadventurer@me.com's excessive vegan extremism. They go on and on about animal rights but have no qualms about endangering innocent creatures in the game. It's the height of hypocrisy! I demand you address this issue and put an end to their twisted sense of morality ruining our gaming experience.</p>
